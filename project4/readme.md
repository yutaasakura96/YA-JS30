# Success / Fail Modal Box 🎉❌

This project implements a stylish **Success** and **Fail** modal box using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The modal boxes are triggered by buttons and include smooth animations with custom icons for both success and failure scenarios.

## Features 🚀

- **Two Distinct Modals**: Includes one modal for success (`Success!`) and one for failure (`Fail!`), each with its own color scheme and icon.
- **Smooth Animations**: Modals have smooth transitions when they open and close.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be responsive across different screen sizes.
- **Font Awesome Icons**: Icons are used to visually indicate success or failure in each modal.
- **Google Fonts**: Uses custom fonts from Google Fonts (`Wix Madefor Display`).

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **HTML5**: Markup for the buttons and modal boxes.
- **CSS3**: Custom styles for the modals, buttons, animations, and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Used to trigger the modals and handle the open/close functionality.
- **Font Awesome**: For success (`fa-check`) and failure (`fa-x`) icons.
- **Google Fonts**: For applying the `Wix Madefor Display` font.

## How It Works ⚙️

- When a user clicks on the **Success** or **Fail** button, the corresponding modal is triggered and displayed with a smooth animation.
- Each modal has a button inside (e.g., "Go Ahead" for success, "Try Again" for fail) which, when clicked, closes the modal.
